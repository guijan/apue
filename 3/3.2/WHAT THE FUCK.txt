HOW THE FUCK IS THIS EVEN SOLVED
WHAT A STUPID ASS EXERCISE
I SKIMMED THROUGH POSIX MANUALS AND LOOKED AT THE DESCRIPTION OF EVERY OPENBSD
MAN PAGE WITH unistd.h AND fcntl.h INCLUDES ON OPENBSD, AND READ PART OF THE
MOST RELEVANT ONES, AND FOUND NO WAY TO PERFORM THIS TASK
I HAD TO SEARX IT AND I ONLY FOUND A REPOSITORY WHERE THE GUY WAS SMARTER THAN
ME AND HE FUCKING USED dup() TO DUPLICATE FDS UNTIL ONE WITH THE RIGHT NUMBER
CAME OUT, WHAT THE ABSOLUTE SHIT?
